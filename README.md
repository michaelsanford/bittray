A system tray application for monitoring your BitBucket pull requests, written in Go.

## Archived ðŸ“¦

This project is now _archived and unmaintained._

It is replaced by [bittray 2 - a rewrite in .NET](https://github.com/michaelsanford/bittray-2) (still in development).

## API Support

This version supports [Bitbucket REST API v1.0](https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/rest/4.10.1/bitbucket-rest.html).

It's tested to work up to Atlassian Bitbucket v5.16.3.

I do plan to update it to API 2, once I have a need. Non-breaking PRs to that end are welcome (but please file an issue).

## Details and Use

See <https://michaelsanford.github.io/bittray/> for details.

## Building with Windows Resource Extensions

You'll need Electron's [`rcedit-x64`](https://github.com/electron/rcedit/releases) in your PATH before continuing.

By default, Windows 10's PowerShell Execution Policy is set to `Restricted`. To build, you'll need to temporarily set that to `Unrestricted` for the packager to run.

You _do not_ need to run it with Administrative privileges.

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted .\build.ps1 -version 0.0.0
```

Make sure `config.CurrentVersionTag` (in `constants.go`) matches what you provide in `-version`.

Read up on [PowerShell Execution Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies).
