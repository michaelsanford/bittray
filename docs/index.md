_Bittray_ is a tiny system tray application written in [Go](https://golang.org/) that polls a Bitbucket Enterprise / Stash API 1.0-compatible
server for new pull requests that you need to act on.

It's tested to work up to Atlassian Bitbucket v5.16.3 up to v6.10.2.

# Testimonials

> Bittray has made our code review process much more efficient - I no longer have to sift through dozens of notification e-mails from Stash to know when I have a Pull Request to review. The icon change is visible enough to be noticed without being annoying and it's a quick click to the list of Pull Requests. I've loved using it so far! _-Laura V._

> Bittray is useful to keep track of PRs to review so ti's quite useful and super easy to install and use _-Eric K._
